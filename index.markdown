## Projects
- **Roots (HackMIT Meta-Sponsored Winner)**\\
  A 3D audio-visual experience controlled by an Arduino dial teaching a valuable lesson about the duality of altruism and self-preservation.
  Relevant Technologies: C++, Unity, Blender, Arduino, Audacity.

- **Poetry in Concert**\\
  Poetry AI for use in classical concerts to generate poems based on audience-submitted words. Utilized graph algorithms to consolidate words into synonym cliques and trained AI to generate stanzas for each clique. Relevant Technologies: Python, AI, NLP, Web Scraping, Selenium, SpaCy, Google Drive API, TensorFlow, WordNet.

- **Pittsburgh Bakery Website**\\
  Created web-based application with model-level validations, callbacks, API documentation, unit controller tests, and partials.
  Generated data analytics, wireframes, and visualizations to adopt more user-centered design.
  Relevant Technologies: Ruby on Rails, Model View Controller, REST APIs, RegEx, Software Architecture, UIUX, Data Analysis.

- **Proxy**\\
  Implemented an HTTP proxy server allowing memory caching and concurrent requests via multithreading.

- **Shell**\\
  Built a functioning Unix shell that manages signals, I/O redirection, and background/foreground jobs through multiprocessing

- **Malloc**\\
  Wrote a dynamic memory allocator for C with better fit algorithm to maximize throughput and utilization.

- **Birds**\\
  Leveraged threads to create, queue, and play algorithmically composed melodies in parallel to produce a non-repeating, infinite stream of music alongside original graphics of landscapes and “birds on wires” that visually personify the notes you hear.

- **MIRAGE (Hack112 1st Place Prize)**\\
  Developed program to process, analyze, and transform images into resembling MIDI “music portraits” using edge detection.
  Relevant Technologies: Python, Pillow, MIDI, FluidSynth, Numpy.

- **Dots (HackCMU Prize Winner)**\\
  Collaborative virtual canvases (accessible via QR codes) located in different department buildings on campus to display collective artistic vision of students.
