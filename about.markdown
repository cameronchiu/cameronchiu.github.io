Hi!\\
\\
My name is Cameron and I'm a junior at Carnegie Mellon University studying Computer Science. On this site you will find information about my academic and professional career, along with projects that I have completed or am currently developing. I'm passionate about many things--software, computer science, music, art, coffee, film, cooking--but I have a special place in my heart for classical music (my pre-CS endeavor). I like to view coding as an artform and am inspired to bring artistic depth to every project I work on. Happy browsing :)
